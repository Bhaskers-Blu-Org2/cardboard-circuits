# Tools

This page provides an overview of tools that you will (eventually) need to build your modules.

* **Make sure to always read the safety notice of each individual tool.**

## Philips screwdriver

To open a toy, you will have to unscrew a large number of Philips screws. Students should have access to a wide range of screw driver sizes.

## Wire cutter

## Wire trimmer

## Scissors

## Cardboard scissors

Cardboard can be challenging to cut with regular scissors.

## Glue gun

An absolute must in the Maker toolbelt is the glue gun. 

* **Tip** Purchasing glue stick in bulk (e.g. 25 pound box) is MUCH cheaper than per small individual bags.

## Soldering Iron

* **Tip** 1 soldering station per classroom is typically enough for a start
