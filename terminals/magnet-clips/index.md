## Safety first

Magnets should be kept away from young children.

## Materials

* Recycle wire
* 2 small magnets

* Get a cooking pan and some cookie sheets. Place the cooking sheet on the pan and sandwitch the trimmed cable between
the magnets.

* Position the cardboard box on top of the cable and magnets. If needed, cut out a small opening for the cable.

* Fill mold with hot glue and let the glue cool down (seriously, wait...). Once the glue has settled, unstick from the sheet - it's ready

* Extra points: add more cardboard around the cable to ensure that it would be ripped away.
