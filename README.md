# Cardboard Circuits

## A DYI electronic module system for kids.

Cardboard circuits is electronic module system that allows kids to build circuits. Modules are built by the kids themselves and electronic parts are sourced from deconstructing toys and other every day electronic gadgets. The modules are built from common classroom materials such as cardboard and binder clips \(no soldering required\).

### Destroying provides Context

As kids source the electronic parts from existing toys and machines, it gives an additional context to those components. A potentiometer is a somewhat boring and un-interresting element at first sight - however if it was extacted from a racing wheel controller, it gives that item a context meaningful to the children. Hence, their interrest is peaked and they understand why such component is important.

### Built kids for kids

In this module system, modules are built by the children themselves. A module can be large, small, round, square, blue, red, or in a unicorn shape as long as its electronic functionality works as expected: a switch is a switch even if it is covered with sparkling glue. Kids will naturally build modules to their taste, modules that have the right size for their hands, modules that have their favorite colors, modules that they want to reuse and can relate to.
