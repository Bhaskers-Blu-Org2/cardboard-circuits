# Cardboard Circuits

WORK IN PROGRESS

## A DYI electronic module system for tinkerers.

Cardboard circuits is electronic module system that allows kids to build circuits. Modules are built by the kids themselves and electronic parts are sourced from deconstructing toys and other every day electronic gadgets. The modules are built from common classroom materials such as cardboard and binder clips.

### Destroying provides Context

As kids source the electronic parts from existing toys and machines, it gives an additional context to those components. A potentiometer is a somewhat boring and un-interresting element at first sight - however if it was extacted from a racing wheel controller, it gives that item a context meaningful to the children. Hence, their interrest is peaked and they understand why such component is important.

### Built by kids for kids

In this module system, modules are built by the children themselves. Kids will naturally build modules to their taste, modules that have the right size for their hands, modules that have their favorite colors, modules that they want to reuse and can relate to.

### No blueprint, improvise

A module can be large, small, round, square, blue, red, or in a unicorn shape as long as its electronic functionality works as expected: a switch is a switch even if it is covered with sparkling glue.

### No soldering required

Connections between modules are made via crocodile clips and binder clips. Using a bit of aluminium foil, a binder clip and hot glue, kids are able to manufacture their own connection -- without having to learn soldering. Just like Circuit Boards, modules can be connected together with tape, elastics and others.

### Read (and write) the manual!

Kids use the cardboard to down a manual of the component
they just built.

### Microcontrollers welcome

Students can use any microcontroller to build specialized modules, such as sound generation, servo or motor controllers. These modules may even involve breadboards!

### Safety first

Cardboard circuits recipes provides clear instructions on how to protect circuits from accidental (and common) shorting, overloading or other misuses.

### Testing, testing, testing

As kids build their own modules, they are constantly encourage to test their circuits. Testing and validating a module is cornerstone of the approach. As a side effect, the students build a robust mental model of the components they are working with.

## Connectors

Cardboard circuits are made of materials easily found in classrooms:
cardboard, binder clips and hot glue.

### Cable to binder clip

This is the most common connection between an electrical cable and a binder clip.
The springness of the binder clip arm is used to create a reliable connection with the cable without having to solder.

#### Step 1: Attach the binder clip

Position the binder clip to the side of the cardobard

#### Step 2: Clamp the cable

Lift the binder clip arm and clamp the cable under it.

##### Cable too thin?: Add foil

If the cable is too thin on step 2, add a layer of Aluminium foil between the binder and the binder arm.

#### Step 3: Testing!

Use a multi-meter or a connection tester to make sure that your connection
works... before adding glue!

#### Step 4: Glue it all

### (Optional) Step 5: Add rubber bands

You can optionally add rubber bands to improve the connection on the connector.

You can run the rubber accross the module when positioning the clips on opposite sides of the board.

#### Tips and tricks

* Test all your connection before gluing them. Be generous with glue.
* Use colored markers to describe the purpose of each connector.
* Trimming a cable with a cable cutter can be very trickly... and lead to no more cables! We highly recommend getting cable trimmers which make this operation seamless for kids.
* Thicker cables can be attached without Aluminium foil. Trial and error is generally the best way to determine if you can skip that step.
* Rubber bands can be used to strengthen the connection and ensure it does not get ripped out.

### Metal ring to binder clip

Some component may not have cables but have metal rings. Potentiometers or the micro:bit are example of those. 

### Paper fasterners

Paper fasteners allow to cramp on metal legs from resistors, diodes and other electronic components. They are very useful to create a small ad-hoc circuit involving resistors or LEDs.

## Modules

### Power

The modules assume that a 5V DC electrical power is available.
3 AA batteries, 4 recheargable AA or any USB power brick will do.

* Use a black and red marker to clearly mark the ground 
and positive connectors on the module.

#### USB power pack

USB power packs are fairly inexpensive and easy to charge,
which makes them a great choice to build circuits.
In order to tap in the 5V power, you will need to cut open 
a USB cable and connect the ground/positive cables to binder clip
connections.

TODO

#### Short protection with fuses

It is likely that the kids will create shorted circuits
which can damage dramatically the batteries.

To protect your power module, 
add a reversible fuse to the circuit. The fuse will heat up 
when too much current is flowing and will eventually "pop". Once it cools down, it will work again. Since the fuse gets hot, you'll need to build a heat barrier with Aluminium foil.

TODO

### Switch

Most electronic toys have a switch that can be harvested.

### Potentiometer

### DC motor

### Microcontroller

### DC motor controller

### More modules

There are some many other eletronic components out there and this guide is not meant to be exhaustive. Be creative, curious, read up on the components you find and tell us what you were able to build!
