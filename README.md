# Cardboard Circuits

WORK IN PROGRESS

## A DYI electronic module system for tinkerers.

Cardboard circuits is electronic module system that allows kids to build circuits. Modules are built by the kids themselves and electronic parts are sourced from deconstructing toys and other every day electronic gadgets. The modules are built from common classroom materials such as cardboard and binder clips.

### Destroying provides Context

As kids source the electronic parts from existing toys and machines, it gives an additional context to those components. A potentiometer is a somewhat boring and un-interresting element at first sight - however if it was extacted from a racing wheel controller, it gives that item a context meaningful to the children. Hence, their interrest is peaked and they understand why such component is important.

### Built by kids for kids

In this module system, modules are built by the children themselves. Kids will naturally build modules to their taste, modules that have the right size for their hands, modules that have their favorite colors, modules that they want to reuse and can relate to.

### No blueprint, improvise

A module can be large, small, round, square, blue, red, or in a unicorn shape as long as its electronic functionality works as expected: a switch is a switch even if it is covered with sparkling glue.

### No soldering required

Connections between modules are made via crocodile clips and binder clips. Using a bit of aluminium foil, a binder clip and hot glue, kids are able to manufacture their own connection -- without having to learn soldering. Just like Circuit Boards, modules can be connected together with tape, elastics and others.

### Microcontrollers welcome

Students can use any microcontroller to build specialized modules, such as sound generation, servo or motor controllers. These modules may even involve breadboards!

### Safety first

Cardboard circuits recipes provides clear instructions on how to protect circuits from accidental (and common) shorting, overloading or other misuses.

### Testing, testing, testing

As kids build their own modules, they are constantly encourage to test their circuits. Testing and validating a module is cornerstone of the approach. As a side effect, the students build a robust mental model of the components they are working with.
