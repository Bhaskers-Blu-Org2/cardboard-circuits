## DYI electronic modules for tinkerers

![A LED dimmer circuit]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/leddimmer.gif)

**#cardboardcircuits** are electronic modules built of cardboard, glue and scrap electronics. Modules are built by the kids themselves and electronic parts are sourced from deconstructing toys and other every day electronic gadgets. The modules are built from common classroom materials such as cardboard and binder clips. Cardboard circuits are inspired from Tinkering Studio [circuit boards](https://tinkering.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/Instructions/circuit_boards.pdf), [toy deconstruction](https://tinkering.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/Instructions/toy_take_apart_0.pdf), and [others]({{site.baseurl}}/reference).

### Deconstructing provides Context

As kids source the electronic parts from existing toys and machines, it gives an additional context to those components. A potentiometer is a somewhat boring and un-interresting element at first sight - however if it was extracted from a racing wheel controller, it gives that item a context meaningful to the children. Hence, their interest is peaked and they understand why such component is important.

### Built by kids

In this module system, modules are built by the children themselves. Kids will naturally build modules to their taste, modules that have the right size for their hands, modules that have their favorite colors, modules that they want to reuse and can relate to.

### No soldering required

Connections between modules are made via crocodile clips, binder clips or paper clips. Using common classroom materials, kids are able to manufacture their own modules -- without soldering. Just like Circuit Boards, modules can be connected together with tape, elastics and others.

### Build your own modules

Using colored masking tape, [little Bits color convention](http://discuss.littlebits.cc/t/what-do-the-different-colors-of-modules-mean/157) can
also be used to categorize the modules: power = blue, input = pink, output = green, wire = orange and (new) controller = yellow.

Kids can also use the cardboard to write a manual for the component they just built.

### (Micro-)Controllers welcome

Students can use any microcontroller to build specialized modules, such as sound generation, servo or motor controllers.

### Code your modules!

Learn to code as you make your modules. The [Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.com) editors are web-based and beginner friendly.
