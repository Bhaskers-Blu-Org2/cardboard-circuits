# Toys

Deconstruction suggestion for common toys found in thrift shops
and garage sales.

### Game Controller

A typical game controller is stuffed with buttons, vibrators
and other cools sensors. To open it up, you would typically need
a small Phillips screwdriver.

* remove all the screws from the enclosure and open up the controller.

* If you are lucky, the controller has a "vibrate" feature and you'll find 2 DC motors in the handles. Remove them and keep as much cable as possible.

* assemble the motors into two modules so that you can use them in other projects!

### RC race car

A RC race car will usually have 2 or 3 DC motors and some radio electronics to control it. We can open it, remove the radio controller and wire the motors into a module.
