# Game Controller

A typical game controller is stuffed with buttons, vibrators
and other cools sensors. To open it up, you would typically need
a small Phillips screwdriver.

* If you are lucky, the controller has a "vibrate" feature and you'll find 2 DC motors in the handles. Remove them and keep as much cable as possible.

* assemble the motors into two modules so that you can use them in other projects!
