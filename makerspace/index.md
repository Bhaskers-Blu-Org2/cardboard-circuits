# Maker space

Cardboard circuits is inherently a team activity. Some of the tasks are better done with more than 2 hands!
As usual, these are recommendations, do what works for you.

## Tables and Teams

We recommend to split the students in teams and allocate each table to a table.
The team is responsible for maintaining the working order of the table, cleaning and maintaining its toolbox.

## Color coded tables and tools

All tools look alike and students tend to roam around and leave them. To avoid "it's my tool, not it's my tool" situations, we strongly recommend to color code them.

Assign a color to each team and use colored masking tape to mark their table. Then have the students mark all their tools with tape as well. That way, at the end of a session, it is very easy to sort out all the tools that have been spread around the classroom.

Encourage tables to inventory their tools to ensure that none of those are missing.

## Bins: tools, modules, parts

Simple bins can be used to easily tidy up and organize a table.
