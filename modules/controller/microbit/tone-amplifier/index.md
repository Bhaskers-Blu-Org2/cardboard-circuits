# micro:bit Tone Amplifier

![micro:bit as speaker amplifier]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/modules/controller/microbit/relay/speakercircuit.jpg)

The **micro:bit** music blocks control the pin ``P0``. This current from this pin needs to be amplified in order to play in large speakers. Fortunately, the micro:bit produces very basic sounds (square sound waves) that can be amplified with a single transistor.

This module is built like the [relay]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/controller/microbit/relay).
