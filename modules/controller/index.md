# Controllers

Microcontrollers are tiny computers that receive and generate electrical currents. They can be used to control motors, lights and sounds.
Some microcontrollers have built-in sensors and buttons which makes even easier to integrate them in your project. 
We will use microcontrollers supported by https://makecode.com in this guide but there are many others out there.

## Don't fry me

Microcontrollers interact with other electronic devices via their _pins_ using _small_ current. 
Without proper protection, it is really easy to accidently destroy the board by plugging the wrong cables or pulling too much current.
Any pin connected to a terminal should be properly protected.
