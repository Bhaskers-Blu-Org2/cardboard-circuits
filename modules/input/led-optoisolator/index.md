# LED optoisolator

The optoisolator uses 2 LEDs connected on different circuits.
The input circuit controls the emitting LED and turns it on when the input is high. 
The receiving LED is used in reverse and acts as a light sensor connectoed to the micro-controller pin, which can pick up the tiny voltage variation
that occurs when the LED is turned on.
